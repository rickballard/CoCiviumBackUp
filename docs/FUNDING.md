# Funding & Gifts

## Current status
- **Temporary:** The GitHub *Sponsor* button points to **DogsnHomes** (family charity).  
  Gifts there support **DogsnHomes’ charitable work**, **not** CoCivium operations.
- **Planned:** We’re setting up **Open Collective (cocivium)** as the canonical, transparent,
  **no-strings-attached** funding rail for CoCivium.

## No-strings policy
- Support does **not** buy editorial control, roadmap control, governance power, or privileged access.
- We publish how funds are used at a high level (notes/finances).

## When Open Collective is live
- Funds are held by a **fiscal host**; stewards approve expenses tied to visible work.
- Typical categories: writing, research, engineering, design, operations.
- Monthly transparency notes will summarize inflows/outflows and cash on hand.

## Conflicts & ethics
- We avoid arrangements that compromise safety, rights, or community trust.
- If a gift could create a conflict, we’ll disclose it or decline it.
