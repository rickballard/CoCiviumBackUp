# CoCivium Writing & File Style

## Names & slugs
- Filenames are lowercase-with-dashes; prefer semantic names (e.g. \adiant-network.md\).
- Keep \_cN\ and \_YYYYMMDD\ only in **draft/imported** filenames. Canonicals are clean slugs; the version/date live in frontmatter.

## Markdown
- Wrap lines softly (no hard-wrapping mid-sentence).
- Use \#\ for document title, \##\ for main sections.
- Prefer relative links; avoid absolute GitHub URLs inside canonicals.

## Provenance
- Never copy content into a canonical without \source.*\ frontmatter.
- When replacing: add the prior drafts to \supersedes:\.

## Minimum content (no stubs)

- Avoid stub pages. Aim for at least **4 concrete ideas** (or a tight 150–300 words) per new canonical file.
- Every file should end with a small **“Next”** footer (links to related docs or open questions).
- If a placeholder is necessary, keep it under `/notes/` or a PR draft; don’t add empty folders.
