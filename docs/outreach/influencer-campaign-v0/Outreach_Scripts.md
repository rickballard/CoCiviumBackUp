Hi <Name> — we’re assembling a consent‑first governance pack for agentic AI (CoCivium).  It complements safety work: agency + auditability before deployment.  Would you skim the open charter and leave a comment?  <short link>  —Rick (Oakville, CA)

Subject: Quick review? “Consent before coercion” governance pack for agentic AI

Hi <Name>,

I’m Rick (CoCivium).  We’re publishing a concise, portable governance pack that teams can adopt before exposing agentic capabilities.  Think: explicit consent rules, pre‑deployment agentic risk gates, and incident reporting — designed to fit alongside current safety methods.

Would you:
1) Skim the charter (10 min) and suggest edits?
2) Consider a short endorsement or a quote?
3) If useful, join a 60‑min roundtable with peers next week.

Links: <charter>, <FAQ>, <roundtable scheduler>.
If “not now,” a one‑line “pass” still helps calibrate.

Thanks,
Rick
