## What each trigger means

### CoPIN — record a decision
- Writes an entry to dmin/history/decisions/DECISIONS_YYYYMM.md using 	ools/Pin-Decision.ps1.
- Structure: **DO** (imperatives you can paste), then **ADVISORY** (tips/explanations).

### CoPreview — preview README safely
- Keep main protected; preview branches use eadme/preview_*.
- Renders at: **gh browse README.md --branch <preview>**

### CoPR — create a PR (small, reversible)
- Squash-merge pattern, tiny diffs, human review.

### CoEOD — checkpoint & tag
- Writes dmin/history/progress/LOG_* and pushes od-* tag.

### CoSweep — repo hygiene
- EOL normalization (LF), broken-link report, markdown H1 checks.

### CoStatus — status pings
- Assistant posts a short “Working on: <topic> …” note during longer tasks.

### CoOneTask — automation hygiene
- Keep **one** scheduled task (daily) that reads a **repo bucket** (YAML/MD).
- Prefer GitHub Actions for cadence work.
