# Press Pitch (one-pager)

Angle: A “consent‑before‑coercion” coalition for agentic AI — portable governance that preserves dignity and agency while raising safety bars.

Why now: Agentic capabilities are shipping.  Most orgs lack a concrete, neutral pack they can adopt pre‑deployment.  CoCivium fills that gap: explicit consent rules, agentic risk gates, auditable incident reporting.

What’s new: Moves beyond vibes and analogies (“mother AI”) to measurable gates: deception/shutdown compliance, resource‑seeking limits, user‑autonomy preservation, privacy respect — all before tool access expands.

Assets: Open charter + FAQ, influencer landscape (analysis, not endorsements), demo adapter list, public RFC, roundtable calendar.

Spokesperson: Rick Ballard (founder, CoCivium).  Availability: media Q&A and roundtables.
