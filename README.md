## Fix The World.

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **WHY** : Democracies are in retreat, while AI takes over administration of our increasingly polarized and unregulated digital societies.  

We need guardrails that scale with agency, regardless whether AIs become souls, slaves or scapegoats, so we can **ALL** fairly cohabit our shared, borderless digital world.  

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **WHO** : Humans, AIs, and hybrid minds must cooperate to rebuild consent-first "hybrid societies".  Stop shouting into the wind and help defend Democracy, tame the singularity, and fix the world.  Join debates, agree rules, then ship them out, ready to work.

</blockquote>

<img src="./assets/icons/how-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **HOW** : (1) Listen widely to everyday people and experts, (2) Help everyone co-evolve an open, ever-green CoConstitution, (3) Run fast policy loops, (4) Ensure evidence beats bullshite, (5) Use functional ethics and blockchain accountability.  

More How : This Github repo aggregates and preserves ALL public wisdom, turning **your good ideas** into vibe-coded upgrade packages for governments and organizations, auto-shipping them to society's administrators who need us, to stand with them, to save Democracy.  Meanwhile, **your best ideas** flow through our open-access CoConstitution as it gently realigns to fit emerging lifestyles and regulatory needs.  This CoConstituion also tracks "ethical intent", responsible accountability, smart processes and evidential policies (based on verifiable truths).  No Coercion, No Deep State, No Kings.

## We The People, Empowered

<img src="./assets/icons/life-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **LIFE** : Democracies are in decline as elites gain wealth and power, as entire populations are manipulated by lies, propaganda and information ops, as geopolitical fragmentation brings policy volatility, economic wars and military invasions.  Are governments supposed to serve, or be served?  

<img src="./assets/icons/feels-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FEELS** : It feels like Governments are losing their dignity and society is breaking down.  It's too easy to sit back and accept that resistance is futile, or that half the country has lost the plot, succumbing to partisan hostility and tribal reflexes.  Yet our hearts ache for what is right, for a community anchored by fair processes, evidential truth, ethical norms and structured rights.  

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **BROKEN** : Some fight back, rage against rage, hate against hate, but this multiplies the damage.  Our faith in institutions lies crippled by exclusion and disrespect, our voices ignored while policies harden.  But anger breaks like an "insanity tsunami", bringing more coercion.  

<img src="./assets/icons/until-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **UNTIL** : There is a better operating system for society, but it requires profound updates to our country Constitutions and our civic frameworks.  CoCivium's CoConstitution (The Cognocarta Consenti) is a baseline anyone can adopt and evolve, for free, no strings attached.  

<img src="./assets/icons/governments-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **GOVERNMENTS** : Many public institutions rely on civic architecture developed before typewriters.  Few of their policies can be evolved by those they impact, and they continue to fall behind as society offers biotech brains, neural interfaces, ubiquitous networks and augmented reality; a very different society‚Äîexistential for humanity‚Äîyet so unregulated it risks lawless chaos.  

<img src="./assets/icons/coevolve-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **COEVOLVE** : Here we create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at a speed and scale that allows governance to react, iterate and continually improve.  As AIs achieve agency, and as Artificial General Intelligence approaches singularity, we more urgently require effective guardrails to keep power accountable (the triad is accountability, transparency, reversibility).  

<img src="./assets/icons/solutions-line.svg"   alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **SOLUTIONS** : Our job here is to <strong>Protect, Prove, Play</strong>. So when we say <strong>Protect</strong> we keep power accountable (access controls, audit trails, red-team/bug-bash); <strong>Prove</strong> makes claims verifiable (trusted-source credentials, signed evidence bundles, provenance checks); <strong>Play</strong> ensures fair rules for people and human‚ÄìAI teams (ethical norms, symmetric obligations, clear appeals).  

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg"     alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FOR YOU** : If you can picture society working better, or if you can test ideas against evidence, you already qualify as a civic architect for CoCivium.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and use the below links to join in, measure progress and help others to help you.

## How To Help

* Read **CONTRIBUTING.md**.
* File an issue tagged `domain`, `product`, `ops`, `ci`, `wiki`, `content`, `refactor`.
* All merges pass through **HumanGate** for now.  Stewardship will decentralize as CoCivAI matures.

*Quickstart scripts are PowerShell-first, with GitHub CLI helpers.  See `admin/setup/`.*

## Performance

![Two-Eyes Status ‚Äî replace with ./assets/status/two-eyes.png](./assets/status/two-eyes.png "If missing, this is a placeholder visualization.")

*Legend:* Left eye = **Document quality & coherence**.  Right eye = **Operational readiness & adoption**.  Each iris ring tracks a dimension (CI, Coverage, OFS, LSH, DTI, Throughput, LT(inv), EE).  Replace the image with an auto-generated chart when wiring CI.

## CoConstitution (Cognocarta Consenti)

* **Purpose.** A consent-first constitutional core meant to be adopted alongside, not over, existing constitutions.
* **Lineage.** Drafted by the CoCivium community; versioned and amendable via transparent process.
* **Versioning.** `cc-v1`, `cocivop-v0.1`, `cocivproc-v0.1.0` (machine tags) with human aliases on site.

> **Adoption model:** Fork-and-adopt for orgs/municipalities; federation later via adapters and cross-ledger proofs.

---

## Strategy Roadmap

* **Short:**  Migration finish; CI for congruence/hash/gibberlink checks; PR previews.
* **Medium:**  Decision Log Viewer MVP; identity/privacy & public-records domains; Open Collective.
* **Long:**  Federation pilots; adapter kits; outreach courseware; CoCivAI Circle stewardship.

## Housekeeping

* **Repo map:**  `README ‚Üí Start Here ‚Üí Quickstart`.
* **Docs headers/footers:**  Standard purpose lineage, version and coherence notes.
* **Brand note:**  Ensure assets live under `./assets/` with SVG + PNG fallbacks.

  <summary><small>About the category & our stance</small></summary>
  <small>CoCivium is one implementation of an open pattern where <strong>individuals</strong> turn ideas into adoptable policy/standards packs.  The pattern is illustrated in our <a href="https://cocivium.org/map">Master Influence Flow Diagram (MIFD)</a>.  We welcome compatible forks and independent competitors, aiming for interoperable tooling and datasets so multiple platforms can converge as society learns what works.  Organizations do not govern CoCivium; they are recipients and venues to be influenced.  One person‚Äîoptionally working with their AI‚Äîcounts as one voice.  We continue to debate how an AI, an AI-collective like CoCivAI, or a post-identity AGI, should be fairly treated as a CoCivite, when it/they present as independent voice(s)</small>
