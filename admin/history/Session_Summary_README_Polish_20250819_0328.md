# Session Summary — README canonicalization (20250819_0328)

**Decision:** Root README.md text is **canonical** as of 2025-08-19.  Housekeeping only (assets, links, placeholders, badges).  
**PR:** Merged: README canonical + polish scaffold.  Branch deleted.  
**Why:** Present a finished-looking README during migration; avoid 404s/offline breakage; track polish tasks explicitly.  

**Follow-ups before migration closes:**
- Replace ./assets/hero/hero.jpg and ./assets/status/two-eyes.png with final or CI-generated artifacts.  
- Fill **Start Here** stubs (charter, constitution, process spec, decision-log app).  
- Wire guardrails/provenance/decision-log links to live sections.  
- Confirm LICENSE text; remove placeholder if redundant.  
- Final pass of micro-polish on README as the **culminating migration task**.  

**Guarantees:** No destructive directory ops were used.  Placeholders only created when missing.
