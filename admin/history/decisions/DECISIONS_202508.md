## Adopt Messaging v0 (explainer, hero H1, tagline) + add CoMessage triggers
*When:* 2025-08-22 11:31:05 -04:00

### DO
- Use one-sentence explainer: "…living constitution for digital society… adopt and evolve in public."
- Homepage H1: "Build the living constitution for digital society."
- Tagline: "Write the rules of digital society, together."
- Track messaging in docs/branding/Marketing-Messaging-v0.md
- Add CoMessage / CoPitch triggers to IssueOps cheat sheet.

### ADVISORY
Audience: experts (credibility) and everyday participants (easy onramp). Keep language plain; show the voice→action path.
