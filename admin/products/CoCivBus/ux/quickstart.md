# Quickstart — CoCivBus v0.1
1) Generate a Beacon + bus URL (installer or Matrix room).  
2) Paste this at top of active chats:

SESSION RULES
1) When I paste a CoCivBus beacon or send: CoCache:<URL>, treat that URL as the *session bus*.  
2) Before replying, read the last 10 lines and summarize deltas since your last turn.  
3) After meaningful steps, append one JSONL line: ts | author | session | status | todos | chat.  
4) Never put secrets in the bus.  Keep lines terse.

3) Use CLI/PS or Action to append one-liners at step boundaries.
