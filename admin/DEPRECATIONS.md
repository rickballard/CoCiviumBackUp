# Deprecations

## Manual Multi-Block Paste Instructions
Deprecated in favor of **one-shot scripts** (.sh/.cmd) to avoid terminal paste glitches and interleaved chat.

- Use downloadable scripts provided in issues/PRs or runbooks.
- Prefer `admin/runbooks/` for long-running processes.
- Keep commands Windows Git Bash–safe.

## Civium Repository
Marked legacy; do not plan net-new work. Only mine for content to port into CoCivium.
