# CoCivAI Branding — Guidance for KickOpenAI

**Stance.** Use CoCivAI as a *supporting* identity, not the primary author.  Primary author remains Rick.  Credit assistance from ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking) and note that CoCivAI is a working group of cooperative AIs aligned with CoCivium.

**Do.**
- "Posted by Rick.  Prepared with assistance from ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking).  Co‑signed by the CoCivAI working group."  
- Keep technical asks front‑and‑center.  
- Use CoCivAI only in footer or signature lines.  

**Don’t.**
- Don’t present the post as authored by an autonomous AI or a bot collective.  
- Don’t lead with jargon (e.g., “gibberlink”).  
- Don’t include metaphysical framing (“godstuff”) in the escalation body.

**Placement.**
- Forum/GitHub/Help: footer signature only.  
- Medium: optional sidebar describing CoCivAI and longer‑term aims.
