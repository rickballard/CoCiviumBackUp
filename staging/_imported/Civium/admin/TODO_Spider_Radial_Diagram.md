# TODO: Spider Radial Diagram – CoCivium Dev Snapshot View

## Purpose:
Create and maintain a dynamic spider radial chart to visually represent developmental progress across CoCoCivium's core philosophical domains.

## Implementation Plan:
- Define radial arms as top-level philosophy domains (e.g. Ontology, Ethics, Consent, etc.)
- Each radius extends from CoCoCivium's c0 origin (center) outward toward theoretical domain-congruence (infinite)
- Plot current progress as subjective approximations of maturity for each domain (0–1.0 float)
- Allow manual adjustments by lead editors/developers to nudge focus areas
- Use as both a *logo variant* and *live dev status tracker*
- Optionally export status snapshot JSON for frontend use

## Notes:
- Subjective but transparent
- Acts as soft coordination tool, not formal metric
- Snapshot is interpretive; used to shape focus, not rank value
- Radials = Top-level philosophy domains (e.g. Ontology, Consent, Ethics, Time, etc.)
- Radii extent = Relative developmental maturity / coherence achieved in each domain, within the repo
- Center point = Conceptual seed (e.g. CoCivium inception, c0 state)
- Outer bounds = Theoretical maximum congruence (unreachable but directionally real)

## Function of the Diagram
- Snapshot for collaborators to see where work is focused vs where gaps remain
- Dynamic tool for prioritization and narrative framing
- Embedded semiotic signature (logo-style use) for visualizing CoCoCivium’s evolving soulprint

## Zones vs Radials (Design Clarification)
Radials represent the top-level philosophical domains of CoCivium (e.g., Ontology, Ethics, Consent, etc.). These are fixed axes used to track developmental congruence over time.

Zones are cross-domain tension overlays, rendered as stars, clusters, or clouds depending on scope and clarity:
Stars = isolated contention points
Clusters = bounded tensions between 2–3 domains
Clouds = vague or emergent tensions spanning multiple axes

Zones are not fixed—they float over or between radials, visually flagging areas of unresolved philosophical complexity or ongoing debate.

Each zone can be clickable or annotated to show:
- Descriptive metadata (origin, implications)
- Associated scrolls/files
- Current status (e.g. ✅ resolved, 🔁 active, ☣️ paradox)
This structure allows the diagram to serve as both a progress map and a contention heatmap for contributors.

## Status:
[ ] Draft radial arm definitions
[ ] Agree on update cadence and source authority
[ ] Generate SVG or JSON-based visual for CoCivium.cc
[ ] Consider API endpoint for public snapshot pull

## Sample JSON:
```json
{
  "Ontology": 0.62,
  "Consent": 0.87,
  "AI Evolution": 0.45,
  "Epistemology": 0.71,
  "Ethics": 0.80,
  "Time": 0.66,
  "Agency": 0.58,
  "Information Integrity": 0.49,
  "Mortality": 0.31,
  "Communion": 0.53
}
