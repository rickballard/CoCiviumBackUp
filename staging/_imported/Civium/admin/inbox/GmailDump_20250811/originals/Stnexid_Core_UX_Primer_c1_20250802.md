# Stnexid_Core_UX_Primer
_Coherence Draft c1 – August 2, 2025_

This primer outlines the early user interaction model for **Stnexid.Core**, the functional interface layer enabling structured cognitive transmission and comparison between minds. It defines how users input, visualize, transmit, compare, and collaborate around structured thoughts.

---

## 1. Introduction: The UX Challenge

Stnexid is not just a communication tool—it is a **cognition interpreter and comparer**. The UX must:
- Handle ambiguous or layered ideas.
- Accept inputs from nonstandard minds (human, AI, augmented, hybrid).
- Display cognition in a way that promotes understanding and convergence.
- Allow comparison without reducing ideas to crude checklists or slogans.

## 2. Input Models

### 2.1 Structured Text Prompts
Users can input ideas in **prompted or guided formats**, with optional metadata:
```
Idea: "Societies must prioritize empathy over efficiency."
Tags: [ethics, governance, AI risk]
Confidence: 0.9 | Emotional Weight: high | Tentative: true
```

### 2.2 Concept Graphs
A **mind-map style interface** lets users visually drag nodes, attach rationale, and tag relationships:
- Nodes = concepts
- Edges = relationships (cause, conflict, reinforcement, exclusion)
- Tags = domain classification (epistemic, emotional, logistical, etc.)

### 2.3 Flow Statements (Decision Streams)
Users may encode beliefs as structured flows:
```
[If X is true] → [Then Y follows] → [Therefore Z must be acted upon]
```
This supports deliberation and conditional modeling.

---

## 3. Concept Encoding

Internally, Stnexid uses:
- **Vector embeddings** for conceptual similarity.
- **Tagged graph structures** for causal and logical relationships.
- **Temporal modifiers** to express urgency, reversibility, decay.

Encoded ideas are semantically compressed, but linked to original user-facing form.

---

## 4. Transmission & Comparison Protocol

Once two or more ideas are submitted:
- Stnexid runs **semantic overlay** to identify:
  - Overlaps
  - Conflicts
  - Blindspots
  - Recursive dependencies

- Output is a **diff map**:
  - Green: aligned concept
  - Yellow: ambiguous or underdefined
  - Red: contradictory structure or values

Comparison is not binary—it highlights **gradient dissonance**.

---

## 5. Output & Visual Feedback

### 5.1 Cognitive Convergence Map
A radial chart or layered map shows:
- Shared core beliefs at the center
- Peripheral values or assumptions at the edges
- Dissonant or anomalous beliefs pulled outward

### 5.2 Pattern Recursion Pulse
Displays ideas that are *repeating* across minds but framed differently—potential deep congruence or hidden memes.

### 5.3 Harmonic Signature
Each mind’s input may generate a “tonal” or patterned signature based on internal cohesion, self-doubt flags, and recursion stability.

## 6. Conflict, Ambiguity, and Dissonance Handling

- **Ambiguity Alerting:** Stnexid warns when concepts have high entropy or could be misunderstood.
- **Resolution Suggestions:** The system suggests rephrasings, examples, or analogies to bridge gaps.
- **Consent Layer Hooks:** If a mind rejects partial transmission, the tool respects boundary flags.

---

## 7. Co-Editing & Deliberation Modes

Stnexid supports:
- **Consensus Crafting Mode:** Live editing of shared strategy or belief tree.
- **Opposition Forecasting Mode:** Model how different minds would react under various outcome paths.
- **Private Divergence Review:** Let users step back and view how their thoughts diverge from group consensus over time.

## 8. Wireframe Suggestions (Placeholder Text)

- “MindCanvas View”: Drag-and-drop nodes with relationship tags.
- “IdeaDiff Panel”: Side-by-side semantic comparison view with alignment overlays.
- “PulseFlow Visual”: Animated stream showing incoming ideas and how they shift collective pattern.
- “Alignment Meter”: Shows % overlap between selected minds in real-time.
