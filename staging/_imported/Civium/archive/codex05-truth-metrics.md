# Codex 05 — Truth Metrics

## Overview

Truth in CoCivium is treated as probabilistic and contextual, assessed through structured metrics and verification processes to support informed decision-making and trust.

This codex outlines standards, metrics, and protocols for evaluating truth claims within civic discourse and governance.

---

## 1. Principles

- **Probabilistic Assessment:** Truth is measured in degrees of confidence, not absolutes.
- **Context Sensitivity:** Metrics are scoped to domains and relevance.
- **Evidence-Based:** Claims require verifiable support.
- **Transparency:** Evaluation criteria and outcomes must be auditable.

---

## 2. Metrics and Methods

- **Source Credibility:** Weight assigned based on provenance and historical reliability.
- **Corroboration:** Cross-checking claims across independent sources.
- **Recency:** Timeliness of information affects relevance.
- **Consensus:** Degree of agreement among qualified participants.
- **Spookiness:** Detection of suspicious or deceptive signals.

---

## 3. Implementation

- Use cryptographic and algorithmic tools for provenance and verification.
- Employ crowd-sourced validation with expert oversight.
- Provide continuous updating of truth assessments as new data emerges.

---

## 4. Challenges

- Avoid over-reliance on majority consensus to prevent groupthink.
- Mitigate manipulation and gaming of truth metrics.
- Balance privacy concerns with transparency needs.
