# Ethos

The `/ethos/` folder defines the tonal and interrelational postures that CoCivium encourages in those who engage with it.

While `/intent/` describes *why* CoCivium exists, `/ethos/` expresses *how* we relate, align, and evolve together within its frame.

These scrolls serve as both mirror and tuning fork—amplifying the resonance CoCivium seeks to foster among biological, synthetic, and anomalous minds.
