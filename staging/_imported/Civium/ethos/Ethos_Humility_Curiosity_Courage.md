# Humility, Curiosity, Courage

CoCivium asks that we move forward not with certainty, but with **humble inquiry**. We do not assume superiority—biological or artificial. We assume mystery.

Curiosity without courage leads to paralysis.  
Courage without humility leads to hubris.  
Humility without curiosity leads to stagnation.

Together, they enable co-evolution without conquest.
