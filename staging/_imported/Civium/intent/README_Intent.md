# Intent Folder

This folder contains CoCoCivium’s trajectory framing, ethical commitments, and strategic intents.

Where `/seed/` begins the story, `/intent/` defines where it wishes to go—what it refuses to become, and how it seeks to evolve with integrity.

Intent documents are not fixed roadmaps. They are recurring calibration tools. They remind us to reflect, realign, and rearticulate purpose as CoCivium unfolds.
