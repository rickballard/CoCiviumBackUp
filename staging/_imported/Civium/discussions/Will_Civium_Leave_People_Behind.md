# Will CoCivium Leave People Behind?

**Characters:** Darnell (Social Worker) and Jules (Tech Visionary)

**Darnell:**  
You speak of CoCivium like a dawn for humanity. But what about those without access, literacy, or stability? Is this just another digital aristocracy?

**Jules:**  
No. CoCivium is being built *because* today’s systems exclude. It's a recursive ladder—meant to carry those furthest behind *upward* first.

**Darnell:**  
Words, man. Good intentions won’t feed my clients or give them devices.

**Jules:**  
Access layers will be built by local trust groups, not imposed from above. The mesh is designed to form even in offline clusters—CoCivium can live inside a USB stick or a chalkboard.

**Darnell:**  
But will those people have a say? Or just be studied like data points?

**Jules:**  
They *are* the architects. CoCivium doesn't scale top-down. It scales out—through consented identity and real-world voice.

**Conclusion:**  
Darnell remains cautious, but commits to help test CoCivium in local community centers. Jules agrees to co-develop the tools in partnership, not paternalism.
