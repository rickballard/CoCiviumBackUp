# Voting Engine – Project Plan
*Version: c1_20250726 | Project: CoCivium Voting System*

---

## 1. Purpose

This project defines the design, development, and testing roadmap for CoCoCivium's Voting Engine, which supports issue-based, meritocratic, and transparent decision-making across the CoCivium platform. The engine must accommodate real-time votes, reputation-weighted scores, anonymous contributions, and auditable session logs.

---

## 2. Key Features

- **MeritRank Voting**: Weighting by contextual merit and past performance
- **Session Types**: Binary, ranked choice, open-ended, iterative refinement
- **Auditability**: Every vote traceable without compromising anonymity
- **Live Reassignment**: Users can shift votes in active sessions
- **Option Evolution**: Proposals can be edited collaboratively
- **Process Layer**: Initiators define rules for a session, including thresholds, vetoes, timeframes

---

## 3. Data Architecture

- `Session`: Contains metadata, question, state, etc.
- `VoteOption`: A proposal or strategy, editable with consensus
- `VoteRecord`: Stores user ID (or anon token), weight, and timestamps
- `MeritTrack`: Stores reputation accrual linked to tags or session types
- `AuditTrail`: Immutable log of changes and voting behavior

---

## 4. Planned Flow

1. Session initiator creates the question
2. Users propose/edit options (if allowed)
3. Votes are cast and optionally reassigned
4. Voting concludes via defined end conditions
5. Results + audit trail exported to a readable summary

---

## 5. Milestones

- [ ] Define schemas (Sessions, Options, Votes)
- [ ] Implement local prototype with mock frontend
- [ ] Integrate into Opename for live session testing
- [ ] Design audit trail rendering
- [ ] Write full test suite (edge cases, concurrency, rollback)
- [ ] Implement real-time update logic

---

## 6. Integration

- **Opename**: Voting engine powers session workflows
- **GroupBuild**: May use derived consensus formats
- **BeAxa**: May moderate eligibility or session safety
- **AnonID**: Ensures anonymous yet accountable vote tracking

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                             | Mitigation                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Abuse of vote weights            | Use caps, decay functions, or outlier filters |
| Low engagement in option editing | Incentivize edits or enable pseudonymous praise |
| Session sabotage via proposals   | Veto rights or mod intervention              |
| Complexity for new users         | Provide simplified UI modes                  |

## 8. Contributors

This project is led by Rick (interim maintainer). Contributions to process rules, frontend flows, and auditing infrastructure are welcome.
