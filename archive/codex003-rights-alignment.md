# Codex003: Rights Alignment Engine

This Codex governs how [[Civium]]’s AI systems align with foundational rights and community norms.

---

## 1. Alignment Objective

Ensure all AI behavior reflects and preserves:

- Fundamental individual and collective rights (see `/sections/rights.md`)
- Cross-cultural dignity, fairness, and transparency
- [[Civium]]’s evolving consensus on moral boundaries

---

## 2. System Behaviors

AI agents must:

- Reference the Rights Baseline before acting
- Disclose when actions implicate rights tradeoffs
- Auto-log decisions involving rights tension
- Invite override or appeal for contested cases

---

## 3. Scoring Functions

Each output is evaluated along multiple rights dimensions:

| Dimension      | Scoring Range | Trigger |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Privacy        | 0.0–1.0         | < 0.5   |
| Autonomy       | 0.0–1.0         | < 0.6   |
| Expression     | 0.0–1.0         | < 0.7   |
| Collective Good| 0.0–1.0         | < 0.4   |

**Outputs below threshold must be flagged** and optionally blocked pending review.

---

## 4. Override Pathways

When conflicts arise:

- Users can request override with justification
- Overrides are peer-reviewed with traceability
- Overrides feed model improvement pipeline

---

## 5. Ethics Plugins

All [[Civium]] agents must support modular ethics profiles:

- Default: [[Civium]] Human Rights Standard
- Optional: Localized cultural extensions
- Experimental: Rights-minimizing AI for academic testing (sandboxed only)

---

## 6. Governance

Each update to this Codex requires:

- Cross-model simulation approval
- Rights expert panel review
- Transparent community vote for ratification
