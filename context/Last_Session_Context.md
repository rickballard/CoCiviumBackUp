# Last Session Context — CoCache
**Date:** 2025-08-09

## Current Focus
- Initialize CoCache and link it to CoCivium/GIB workflows.

## Active Projects
- [CoC] CoCivium
- [GIB] GIB (AI-first content)
- [GLX] gibindex (registry)

## Next Steps (short)
- Confirm repo private + CODEOWNERS.
- Decide per-folder sharing model.
- Use templates to run first session bootstrap.

## Notes
