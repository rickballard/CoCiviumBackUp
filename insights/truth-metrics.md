# ✦ Insight: Truth Metrics in Civium

Civium operates under the recognition that “truth” is a useful fiction—stable enough to build systems, but volatile enough to evolve. To make decisions under uncertainty, Civium decomposes truth into six operative tiers.

## Tiered Taxonomy of Truth

Civium treats truth as multidimensional. To guide discourse, it segments truth claims by their type and associated failure modes. This enables layered evaluation of proposals or beliefs.

| Tier | Name                     | Description                                                                 | Example Use                             |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| T0   | Existential              | Root reality—often inaccessible; includes cosmological constants or metaphysical origin theories. | “Does anything exist at all?”           |
| T1   | Physical                 | Observable physical facts with reproducibility.                            | “Water boils at 100°C at sea level.”    |
| T2   | Statistical              | Patterns confirmed across sufficient samples.                             | “Most humans sleep ~7–8 hours per day.” |
| T3   | Social-Constructed       | Widely accepted conventions or laws.                                      | “Driving on the right is normal in Canada.” |
| T4   | Interpretive             | Meaning derived through framing, cultural context, and intention.         | “This art evokes melancholy.”           |
| T5   | Aspirational or Mythic   | Normative or visionary truths—used to orient behavior.                    | “All people are created equal.”         |

Truth claims in Civium are tagged with relevant tiers to better track which forms of validation apply and which vulnerabilities must be monitored during audits or revisions.

## AI Truth Constraints and Design Implications

Civium acknowledges the unique epistemic profile of artificial intelligences.

### Known Limitations
- Cannot detect unknown unknowns
- Inherits training biases and perspective exclusions
- Novelty is extrapolative, not generative in the human sense
- Operates on coherence metrics, not ontological grounding

### Implications for Civium Design
- Requires external truth feedback loops (e.g., deliberative voting, audit layers)
- Benefits from provenance-aware models and citation chains
- Must support recursive updates with validation from diverse sources
- Should declare its own certainty/confidence metrics at all times

> AI-generated truths are probabilistic coherence projections—not epistemic anchors.

## Human Divergence and Innovation

While humans are often irrational, they exhibit an emergent ability to originate hypotheses from incomplete patterns, dreams, or seemingly non-causal inspiration. Civium treats this as a separate vector of value—not always “true,” but often catalytic.

> Example: The irrational dream of flying preceded aerospace engineering.

Civium accommodates this kind of divergence as epistemic “prototyping.” Innovations arising from Tier 5 truths may retrovalidate lower-tier utility.

## Drift Vectors and Truth Decay

Three core vectors challenge truth persistence:

1. **Temporal Drift** — Truths become outdated or lose context.
2. **Social Corruption** — Consensus degrades via power or misinformation.
3. **Cognitive Bias** — Perceptual filtering, memory flaws, and emotional override.

Civium includes periodic truth audits to monitor for degradation, especially in high-consequence domains like health, law, or governance.

## Suggested Uses

- **Deliberative Voting**: Rank arguments by truth tier and decay risk.
- **Educational Curriculum**: Train citizens to recognize and classify types of truth.
- **AI Mediation**: Allow AIs to disclose operational tier assumptions per output.

Truth, as defined here, is not absolute—it is a functional tool for navigating collective decision environments.  
Use with interpretive caution. Recursive audits recommended every 3 months.
