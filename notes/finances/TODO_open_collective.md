# Open Collective — Action Checklist

**Owner:** @rickballard

- [ ] Pick a **Fiscal Host** (Foundation vs OSC vs other) — record choice here.
- [ ] Create collective **cocivium** and save the URL.
- [ ] Add avatar/banner (optional).
- [ ] Configure **expense categories** + **approval rule** (≥1 steward).
- [ ] Invite core stewards as **admins** (for expense approvals).
- [ ] Post a brief **about** page (link to docs/vision + docs/FUNDING.md).
- [ ] Test a **$1** donation; verify payouts to yourself (sanity check).
- [ ] Update repo funding: switch `.github/FUNDING.yml` to `open_collective: cocivium`.
- [ ] Add README badge (Open Collective) and remove “coming soon” callout.
- [ ] Start monthly transparency note in `notes/finances/`.

**Later**
- [ ] Decide product→collective flow (revenue share policy).
- [ ] Consider a legal entity (association/trust/charity) for long-term ops.
