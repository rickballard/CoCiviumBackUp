# Foundational Building Blocks — Challenge Perspective

## Purpose
Define the challenge perspective used when stress-testing CoCivium governance.

## Approach
- Identify the foundational "atoms" of governance (e.g., trust, consent, capability).
- Model threat and resilience scenarios across each.
- Track which building blocks are *stable*, *fluid*, or *volatile* under challenge.

## Notes
This file complements `Insight_Substrate_Assumptions` and `Insight_Forks_Protocol`.
