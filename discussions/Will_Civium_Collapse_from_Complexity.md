# Will Civium Collapse from Complexity?

**Marin (a cautious realist) debates Kael (a systems philosopher):**

Marin: “You’re stacking abstraction on abstraction. Doesn’t that make Civium fragile?”

Kael: “Not fragile—fractal. Like a living forest. Self-similar, distributed, resilient.”

Marin: “But forests burn. Systems collapse.”

Kael: “And they regrow. Collapse is not failure—it’s learning, reforming. Civium expects entropy.”

Marin: “So you’ve engineered for failure?”

Kael: “Yes. Civium is not a glass machine. It’s an evolving organism.”

**Resolution:**  
Civium’s complexity isn’t a bug—it’s an ecology. And ecologies evolve by absorbing disruption.
