# Public Library Council Governance Launch Kit — v0

**Use-case.** Program approvals, policy updates, modest budgets. Public records friendly; evidence mostly URLs.

## Charter Delta (drop-in)
- Define quorum (e.g., simple majority of members of record).
- Define objection window (e.g., 72 hours async or end of meeting live).
- Define appeals path (one appeal cycle; requires new evidence).
- Require evidence links for material claims and execution results.

## Decision Log Scaffold
Copy `/kits/GLK/templates/Decision_Log.md` into your repo and start logging today.

## Role Prompts
Use `/kits/GLK/common/Prompt_Playbook.md` and add sector-specific constraints here.

## Guardrails
Adopt `/kits/GLK/common/Guardrails.md`. Add sector policy hooks here.

## Receipts
Publish agendas, minutes, and execution confirmations in a stable location (repo/docs, wiki, or website) and link them from the log.
