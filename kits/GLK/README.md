# Governance Launch Kits (GLK) — v0

**Purpose.** Practical, minimal scaffolds to launch a consent-first governance initiative in under an hour. Each kit ships with: a charter delta, a decision-log scaffold, role-based Prompt Playbooks, Guardrails, and Receipts guidance. Use as a repo template or copy into your docs/ folder. Evidence links are mandatory. No manifestos. Just receipts.

**Contents.**
- `archetypes/` — sector-specific kits (library, school, HOA/co-op, OSS project).
- `common/` — shared Prompt Playbooks, Guardrails, and checklist.
- `tools/` — Decision Log Linter (local + GitHub Action).

**CTA.** After first decision, publish the log and add the **Concord Mark** per `/mark/USAGE.md`. Evidence or it didn’t happen.

**Version.** 2025-08-14. Maintained by CoCivium.
