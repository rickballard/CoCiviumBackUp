# Codex001: [[RepMod]]
> Reputation-Modulated, Issue-Specific Voting for Signal-Rich Democracy

---

## 🎯 Purpose

[[RepMod]] aims to correct the weaknesses of both mass democracy and centralized technocracy by aligning **voting influence** with **demonstrated merit** and **issue-specific expertise**, while preserving **anonymity**, **forkability**, and **public auditability**.

---

## ⚖️ Core Principles

- **Weight is earned, not assigned**: reputation must emerge from performance, not credentials
- **Issue granularity**: voting power is domain-specific, not global
- **[[Transparency]] by design**: all reputation curves and modifiers must be visible and reviewable
- **Stake-aware**: individuals most impacted by a decision may receive enhanced weight even without technical expertise
- **Resilience to capture**: any model of merit must evolve, fork, and decay when conditions shift

---

## 🧠 Reputation Signal Sources

| Signal Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy Score** | Track record of factual or predictive correctness |
| **Peer Endorsements** | Ratings by trusted peers within a domain |
| **Cross-domain Trust** | Signal overlap from adjacent fields or disciplines |
| **Consequence Weighting** | Degree to which one is impacted by the outcome of the vote |
| **Decay Rate** | All rep decays over time unless re-earned or reaffirmed |

Reputation = `Σ(weighted signals)` × `relevance-to-issue` × `stake-modifier`

---

## 🔁 Evolvability & Forking

- [[RepMod]] functions as a protocol, not a fixed formula
- Every [[Civium]] jurisdiction or use-case may fork, parameterize, or override curves
- Versioned implementations must be stored under `/codices/` and tagged with the parent system

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Verification

- **Votes are pseudonymous by default**, tied to verifiable Rep ID hashes
- **Reputation audits** can be performed by public AI or third-party transparency oracles
- **No vote may be modified** once cast, but dynamic weight updates may be modeled in real-time

---

## 🛠 Example Use Case

> *Climate policy proposal: restrict emissions from AI server farms*

Voter reputation is modulated by:
- Prior engagement in climate forecasting or AI infrastructure
- Historical voting alignment with observed impact
- Stake impact (e.g. developers, residents in heat-affected zones)

Weights are assigned and published **alongside each vote**, not hidden in back-end algorithms.

---

## 🧩 Future Development

- Integration with on-chain CiviumID for pseudonymous identity
- AI-assisted domain matching for self-tagging proposals
- Visual reputation curves for voter transparency
