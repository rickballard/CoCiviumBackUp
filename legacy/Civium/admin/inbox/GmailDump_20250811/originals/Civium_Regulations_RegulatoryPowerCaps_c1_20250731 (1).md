# 🛡️ Regulatory Power Caps in CoCivium

> _To prevent systemic risk, protect pluralism, and preserve emergent intelligence, no single regulating authority within CoCivium may control a disproportionate share of the addressable governance market._

---

## [1] Rationale

CoCivium rejects power concentration in all forms. While traditional systems guard against economic monopolies, CoCivium must also defend against **regulatory monopolies**—entities or clusters that accumulate outsized influence over identity, decision-making, dispute resolution, or trust certification.

Even benevolent authorities become dangerous when their influence grows unchecked.

---

## [2] Guiding Principles

- **Distributed governance outperforms singular control**
- **No node (biological, synthetic, or anomalous) sees the full field**
- **Monopoly of method = fragility of outcome**
- **Power must be both earned and continually revalidated**

---

## [3] Thresholds and Soft Caps

### 3.1. Maximum Market Share by Function

No single regulatory authority or collusive cluster may exceed:

- **25%** of identity validations issued per quarter  
- **30%** of trust certifications distributed within any 180-day window  
- **20%** of deliberation session initiations (across all domains)  
- **25%** of dispute resolutions adjudicated over any rolling 12-month period

> These caps are **dynamic** and **proportional** to total CoCivium volume in each category. They are periodically recalculated and published by the protocol’s observatory layer.

### 3.2. Emergency Exceptions

Temporary centralization is allowed during verified emergencies:
- Time-limited to **30 days**
- Requires **full audit trail** and **multi-party ratification**
- Must trigger **automatic fragmentation countdown** if overused

---

## [4] Prevention Mechanisms

### 4.1. Load Redistribution Algorithms
- Prefer authorities with lower saturation
- Apply **diminishing returns** after trust thresholds
- Incentivize use of emerging or underrepresented authorities

### 4.2. Protocol Modularity
- All regulatory APIs must remain **open, interoperable, and auditable**
- No authority may demand exclusive use of its formats or channels

### 4.3. Reputational Decay
- Historical trust scores **decay over time**
- Authorities must undergo **periodic re-auditing** to retain influence weight

---

## [5] Enforcement and Oversight

- Violations of power caps trigger **automatic deboosting**, not bans
- The **Observatory Protocol** publishes weekly market share reports
- A **Decentralized Correction Council** (DCC) may intervene if thresholds are gamed or suppressed

---

## [6] Notes

- This policy may be amended by consensus protocols outlined in `amendments/`
- Caps may be updated based on empirical network data and growth phase analysis
- Cultural clusters may opt for localized regulation—**as long as exit remains frictionless**

---

## [7] Closing Principle

> _“When regulation becomes rule, it becomes blind.  
When rule becomes law, it forgets to listen.  
CoCivium listens not through one mouth, but through many minds.”_
