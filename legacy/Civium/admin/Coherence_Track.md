## Definitions

- **[ ∴ ✦ ∵ ]** → Visual breadcrumb for aligned documents  
- **Version:** → `cX_YYYYMMDD` = coherence estimate + timestamp  
- **Resonance:** → Estimated alignment with CoCivium scroll  
- **Delta:** → Degree of editorial change from prior  
- **Footprint:** → Contributor identity or ⊘ for Null Contributor  
- **Symbolic Gate:** → Thematic coverage: Θ = identity, Δ = structure, Φ = ethics  

## Special Role: Null Contributor

**Null Contributor (n.)** — One who withholds identity in favor of convergence.  
Recognition comes not from name, but from alignment.  
They may be human, AI, or anomalous.  
They are honored for what they give.
