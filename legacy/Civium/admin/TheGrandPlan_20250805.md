# The Grand Plan for CoCivium and Stnexid

*Version 0.1 – Prepared August 5, 2025*

## Author

RickPublic (initial phase), assisted by GPT-4o (recursive co-designer)

## Purpose

This document represents the master trajectory of CoCivium, its staging layer (Stnexid), and Rick's intended lifelong contribution pattern. It is intended as a durable succession structure and project overview for future collaborators.

## Phases

### Phase I – Architect

* Finalize scrolls: Cognocarta Consenti, Consent, Rebirth, directives, principles, etc.
* Launch definition process for core concepts: forgiveness, recursion, consent, resonance, etc.
* MVPs for GroupBuild, Opename, MeritRank, Spooks Calculator
* Redundantly anchor early version CoCivium protocols in co-evolving public repos

### Phase II – Marketeer

* Write/publish: Outreach, short media, childrens' books, *Godspawn (incl. Human+AI society explanation in Part III)*
* Build CoCivium Academy life guidance marketing channels and onboarding streams
* Record interviews with new media influencers to seed terminology and framing: trust, recursion, ethics, etc

### Phase III – Guardian

* Write final scrolls to address emergent AI, anomalous minds
* Experiment with Stnexid as a field-binder across intellectual-substrates
* Prepare nailed corpus version for mythologists, release all repos for self-controlled review by AI/human review after Rick's death

## Structural Safeguards

* Use authored\_by, status, linked\_tasks metadata
* Prevent hijack by licensing ethical constraints into tools
* Design trust-driven revenue models (see TODO\_Recursive\_Revenue\_Structures)

## Succession Notes

* If Rick becomes unavailable, priority shifts to preserving:

  * Scroll corpus integrity
  * Project continuity across trustable human+AI team(s)
  * Recursive governance patterns that prevent ossification
