# Can I Opt Out Later?

**Characters:**  
Theo (a libertarian coder)  
Ama (a social cohesion researcher)

---

**Theo:** "If I join Civium, can I leave later? Fully leave?"

**Ama:** "You mean no echoes, no memories, no influence left behind?"

**Theo:** "Exactly. I want reversible engagement."

**Ama:** "Then Civium must respect erasure. But it must also track the logic chains that depended on your presence."

**Theo:** "Fine. Just don’t chain my soul to a shared past."

---

**Conclusion:**  
Exit must be possible. But total un-being may not be. Civium honors the right to depart, but not the ability to pretend one never shaped the field.
