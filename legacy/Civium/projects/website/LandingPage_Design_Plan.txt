Add CoCivium Landing Page and Evomap Interface Project Plan

This commit includes the markdown design spec for the CoCivium landing page and the interactive Evomap visualization. It introduces the architectural and symbolic rationale, UX behavior, and artistic tone for a non-editable, poetic interface mirroring the evolution-positive CoCivium repo. Associated visual assets include Civium_Evomap_Mock_up_v1.png and Civium_Logo_v1.png for brand inspiration.
