# README: Resolution in CoCivium

Resolution in CoCivium is not about closure, but about recursive reorientation.
It favors evolution over verdict, convergence over coercion, and interpretive
scaffolding over static rule.

This folder contains the core scrolls detailing how CoCivium resolves tension,
drift, and disagreement—within and across minds, forms, and timeframes.
