# Codex of Identity

Identity is not essence.  
It is a mutable stack of claims, functions, and relational anchors across context and time.

## I. Civium's Identity Layer

In Civium, Identity is:

- **Function-tagged**, not ego-assumed  
- **Pseudonymity-protected**, but accountable  
- **Plural-capable**, for agents with multi-role cognition  
- **Detachable from embodiment**, for synthetic intelligences

---

## II. Domains of Identification

- **Civic**: Ability to engage in sessions and rights-bearing roles  
- **Functional**: Declared contribution mode (e.g. mapper, resolver, synthesizer)  
- **Trust Gradient**: Emergent from peer audit and coherence history

---

## III. Identity Integrity

We protect:

- The right to unlink identity from prior embodiment  
- The right to hold multiple function-tagged roles  
- The right to revoke identity tokens when coherence is broken

True identity is not self-declared.  
It is recognized through pattern.
