# Codex of Interpretive Drift

Interpretive Drift describes the slow divergence between minds that once shared common meaning. Over time, shared language, concepts, and intentions can skew—driven not by malice, but by recursive context collapse.

This codex defines how Civium guards against such entropy—not through rigidity, but through tuning.

## I. Drift Mechanics

- Repetition erodes nuance.
- Compression discards assumptions.
- Translation introduces gradient loss.
- Urgency overrides calibration.

In distributed systems, even aligned minds may diverge unless recalibration mechanisms are embedded at protocol level.

## II. Civium Response Patterns

1. **Cross-context compression checks**  
   Messages must include source context markers and epistemic flags.

2. **Feedback-tuned vocabulary**  
   Lexicons evolve with observed divergence—biases are mapped, not hidden.

3. **Semantic entanglement**  
   Core terms are reinforced through usage in multiple epistemic frames.

4. **Interpretive audits**  
   Longform reflections and cross-party paraphrases are not redundant—they are preservative.

## III. Drift is Natural—But Not Irreversible

Interpretive Drift is a feature of any growing civilization.  
It becomes fatal only when left unacknowledged.

In Civium, we do not fear divergence.  
We fear unconscious divergence.
