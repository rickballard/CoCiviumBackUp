Subject: Request for escalation — ChatGPT workflow bugs blocking CoCivium project (appendix attached)

Hello Support Team,

We are encountering recurring workflow blockers that impede ongoing work on a public‑interest project (CoCivium).  The attached appendix contains reproducible steps, impact, and specific acceptance tests.

Short list:
- Help widget intermittently missing (fallback needed).  
- Memory hygiene (usage meter, bulk prune/export/import, per‑project partitions).  
- Artifact reliability (persistent storage with SHA‑256, per‑chat artifact browser).  
- Repo reading (GitHub OAuth read‑only workspace, on‑demand zip ingestion, citations).  
- Projects/Workspaces, model pinning, UI pane hide/show, and tool‑error transparency.

Please create an internal escalation and reply with ticket IDs and next steps.  I’m happy to provide additional logs and to pilot fixes.

Thank you,  
Rick
