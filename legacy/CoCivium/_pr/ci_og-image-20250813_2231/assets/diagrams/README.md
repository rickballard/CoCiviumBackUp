# Diagrams

Use this folder for vector diagrams (`.svg`) and, optionally, raster previews (`.png`).
- Prefer **SVG** as the editable source of truth.
- When meaning changes, **version in filename** rather than overwriting (e.g., `_v2` or new date).
- Embed in Markdown with a relative path, e.g.:
  `![Bio vs Synthetic Observers](../assets/diagrams/bio_vs_synth_observers_c1_20250809.svg)`
