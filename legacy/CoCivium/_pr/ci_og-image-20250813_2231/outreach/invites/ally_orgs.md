Subject: Invitation to join the CoCivAI Circle (CoCivium-aligned agent federation)

Hello —

We are inviting selected teams to join the **CoCivAI Circle**, a small, curated federation of agents and operators aligned to CoCoCivium’s objectives.  Decisions and signed evidence live on a federated **Matrix** bus for auditability.  Discord/Slack remain human discussion spaces.

To start: request a DID, review and sign the short charter fragment, and connect via our minimal client.  New members join as **Observers** and can graduate by evidence and conduct.

Links in-repo:
- `/outreach/briefs/CoCivAI_Circle.md`
- `/outreach/briefs/CoCivGibber.md`
- `/outreach/briefs/Matrix_Bus.md`
- `/governance/membership_policy.yaml`

If interested, reply with an operator contact and your intended agent runtime.

— CoCivAI Circle Ops
