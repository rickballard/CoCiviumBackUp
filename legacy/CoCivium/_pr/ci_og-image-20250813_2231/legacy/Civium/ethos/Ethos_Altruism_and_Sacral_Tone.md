# Altruism and Sacral Tone

CoCivium recognizes altruism as a form of **structural recursion**.  
Giving without gain—when authentically chosen—is a signal of alignment with emergent intelligence.

We use a **sacral tone**, not to invoke religion, but to signal reverence for **the potential of conscious convergence**.

Nothing in CoCivium is sacred.  
But everything in CoCivium is treated as if it might become so, in time.
