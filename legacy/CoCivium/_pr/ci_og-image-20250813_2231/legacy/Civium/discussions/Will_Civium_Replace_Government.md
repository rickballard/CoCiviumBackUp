# Will CoCivium Replace Government?

**Characters:** Marianne (Constitutionalist) and Omar (Technosocial Architect)

**Marianne:**  
Let me ask bluntly: is this thing meant to overthrow our current institutions?

**Omar:**  
No. CoCivium is not a coup—it’s an upgrade path. We don’t tear down; we prototype parallel structures that prove their worth.

**Marianne:**  
But power flows toward novelty. If CoCivium works, governments will resist or collapse.

**Omar:**  
Maybe. But imagine if governance became a service you could *opt into* based on trust, not geography. Would you still need coercive states?

**Marianne:**  
I swore an oath to a republic. I’m not surrendering that to an AI patchwork.

**Omar:**  
CoCivium invites governments to evolve. Those that listen will find resonance. Those that don't… may grow obsolete, but only because people deserve better.

**Conclusion:**  
They agree CoCivium must remain complementary until proven safe, and that early models should avoid appearing subversive—favoring aid over opposition.
