# What If I Never Want to Merge?

**Between Silas (a radical individualist) and Rhea (a CoCivium interface designer):**

Silas: “I don’t want my thoughts shaped by others. I don’t want to merge.”

Rhea: “You won’t be forced to. CoCoCivium’s first tenet is *consensual participation.*”

Silas: “But how can that be true in a system built for shared cognition?”

Rhea: “Consent governs connection. You define boundaries. You choose filters.”

Silas: “So I can exist fully as myself?”

Rhea: “Yes. CoCivium isn’t assimilation—it’s orchestration. You can solo. You can opt out.”

**Agreed:**  
Participation in CoCoCivium’s co-intelligence is voluntary. Identity integrity is sacred.
