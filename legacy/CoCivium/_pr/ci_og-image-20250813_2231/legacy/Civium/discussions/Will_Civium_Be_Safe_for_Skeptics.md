# Will CoCivium Be Safe for Skeptics?

**A dialogue between Erin (a cautious analyst) and Jiro (a system architect):**

Erin: “If I question CoCoCivium’s assumptions—loudly—will I still belong?”

Jiro: “You will belong *because* you question. CoCivium needs stress tests. That’s the function of minds like yours.”

Erin: “But what if my questions slow down consensus? Or incite fear?”

Jiro: “Then the system must learn to metabolize friction—like joints in a living body. CoCivium doesn’t suppress resistance. It *folds it into strength.*”

Erin: “So it’s safe to resist, if I do it with care.”

Jiro: “Safer than pretending agreement. CoCivium sees dissent as essential diagnostic signal.”

**Tentative Agreement:**  
Skepticism, if constructively framed, is not only permitted but vital to CoCoCivium’s immune system.
