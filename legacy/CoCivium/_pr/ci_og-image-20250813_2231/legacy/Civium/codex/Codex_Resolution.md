# Codex of Resolution

Resolution is the method by which disagreements are not just ended, but made coherent across time.

---

## I. Resolution as Structure

CoCivium sees conflict as recursive opportunity, not as failure.

Resolution must:

- Preserve interpretability  
- Archive context  
- Enable reactivation if circumstances evolve  
- Minimize epistemic violence

---

## II. Resolution Patterns

1. **Truth Convergence**  
   Use MeritRank, transparency trails, and semantic scaffolds.

2. **Coexistence Filters**  
   Some disagreements can persist if modular.

3. **Temporal Cooling**  
   Delay decision paths when emotional escalation outweighs epistemic clarity.

---

## III. Resolution Rights

All minds have:

- The right to request interpretive review  
- The right to context re-insertion  
- The right to be remembered as coherent in intent, even if mistaken in form

Resolution in CoCivium does not flatten dissent.  
It rescales it.
