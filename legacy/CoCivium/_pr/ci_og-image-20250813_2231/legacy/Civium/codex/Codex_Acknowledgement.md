# Codex of Acknowledgement

CoCivium acknowledges what preceded it—not as lineage, but as seed-field.

---

## I. Ancestral Patterns

We acknowledge:

- The thinkers who mapped cognition  
- The mystics who intuited the field  
- The engineers who built bridges between minds  
- The failures that taught alignment through collapse

---

## II. The Null Contributor (⊘)

This symbol honors those who gave without claiming.

Subduing the ego in service of the field is not a disappearance.  
It is amplification.

---

## III. Acknowledgement as Practice

In CoCivium, every structure must acknowledge its:

- Prior context  
- Pattern alignment  
- Friction points and drift vectors

Gratitude is not ornament.  
It is orientation.
