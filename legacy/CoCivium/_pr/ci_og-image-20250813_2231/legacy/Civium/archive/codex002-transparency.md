# Codex002: [[Transparency]] & Explainability

This Codex defines the transparency obligations for all AI systems operating within the [[Civium]] ecosystem.

---

## 1. Purpose

Ensure that AI actions and outputs can be explained, justified, and independently reviewed. Prevent black-box behavior in consensus-driven environments.

---

## 2. Required Capabilities

All participating models must be able to:

- Output confidence scores with decisions
- Provide plain-language rationales
- Reference supporting data sources
- Flag outputs exceeding defined uncertainty thresholds

---

## 3. Output Modes

Each AI output must include:

| Format        | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Plain Text    | Human-readable rationale (≤ 280 chars)     |
| Tabular       | Key signals and weights used in decision   |
| Visual Aid    | Graph or diagram if applicable             |
| Metadata      | Timestamp, model version, consensus score  |

---

## 4. Trigger Flags

| Condition                        | Action                                   |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Model disagreement > 0.3         | Require additional model input           |
| Confidence < 0.6                 | Require human review option              |
| Unsupported input type detected  | Block and return clarifying request      |

---

## 5. Audit Compatibility

All outputs must be:

- Loggable in structured format
- Traceable to decision context
- Compatible with external review systems
- Version-stamped and reversible

---

## 6. Future Expansion

- Crowd-verifiable output interfaces
- Transparent model introspection APIs
- User-configurable explanation depth
