# Last Session Context – CoCivium Regroom

**Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Purpose:** Capture end-of-session state so ChatGPT can resume without losing momentum.

---

## Current Focus
- Drafting `Foundational_Building_Blocks.md` for CoCivium.
- Using **neutral “Challenge Perspective”** wording instead of “Devil’s Advocate”.
- Structuring each principle with:
  1. Definition  
  2. Origin & Chain of Reasoning  
  3. Challenge Perspective  
  4. Response & Safeguards  
  5. Checkpoints for Forks  
  6. Feedback Loop to Consensus Path  
  7. Maturity Rating  
  8. Impact if Broken  
- First three principles to pre-fill:
  - Recursion  
  - Congruence  
  - Emergent Ethics

---

## Agreed Next Steps
1. Format the file as `.md` using CoCivium filename style.
2. Insert placeholder graphics for:
   - Consensus Path diagram
   - Breakaway fork flow
3. Add GIB token placeholders for each principle.
4. Place file in `/foundations` or `/principles` folder.
5. Create compact GIB translation version alongside natural language.

---

## Standing Agreements
- Use filename formats and repo structure rules from intersessional profile.
- Maintain “Challenge Perspective” language for critiques.
- Always check near-final docs for improvements before marking them complete.
