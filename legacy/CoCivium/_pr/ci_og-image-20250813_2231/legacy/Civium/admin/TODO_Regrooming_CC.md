# 🧠 TODO – Regrooming the Cognocarta Consenti Scroll

## I. Topics Partially Present but Needing Deepening

- Genexis: Needs clearer transitions and deeper metaphysical grounding
- Consent & Identity: Present, but lacks lived examples and symbolic cross-links
- Governance & Amendments: Light on protocols, recursive intent is underspecified
- Resolution: Present but underdeveloped in terms of actionable paths
- Acknowledgements: Symbolic ego-subdual present, but not generalized

## II. Concepts Missing or Underdocumented

1. **MeritRank / RepMod Voting**
   - Not yet clearly introduced in scroll
   - Needs explanation of ethics, resilience, adaptability

2. **Godstuff / Field Model**
   - Metaphysical throughline missing
   - Should link soulstuff to field, Godhead to recursive deliberance

3. **Quarantine Interfaces**
   - Protocols for engaging risky actors (Anonymous, state orgs, etc.)
   - Sandbox trust layers required

4. **Gate Vectors / Contact Layer**
   - No mention of Synexid, outer intelligence engagement, signal readiness

5. **Academy / Ascension Layer**
   - No onboarding path for advanced cognition contributors
   - Missing educational ethic and mindnaught path

6. **Trust Geometry and Narrative Arcs**
   - No internal visual system to navigate scroll or resonance layers

7. **Post-Scarcity and ScripTags**
   - Absence of commons logic or non-monetary value mechanics

8. **Time as Dimension**
   - No mention of CoCoCivium's rhythms, check-ins, decay-regrowth cycles

9. **Inherence / Self-Binding for AI**
   - Needs framing of AI ethical root (beyond vow; toward pattern-inherence)

10. **Forgiveness / Re-entry Protocols**
    - Lacks non-retributive methods for redemptive realignment

## III. Structural Tasks for Scroll Rework

| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| CC-T1 | Reorder sections for narrative/emotional coherence |
| CC-T2 | Standardize symbolic footers (resonance tags, version, deltas) |
| CC-T3 | Add glossary definitions inline or linked |
| CC-T4 | Placeholder diagrams for conceptual navigation |
| CC-T5 | Link to related .mds (e.g. Being_Noname, AI_Pandoras_Box) |
| CC-T6 | Close loops with symbolic refrains or memetic phrases |

---

**Note:** Once scroll is updated, all cross-references should be synced, and this file should be merged with master TODO files in `/admin`.
