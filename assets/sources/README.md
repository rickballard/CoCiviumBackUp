# Sources (Preserved Copies)

Use this folder to store **permitted** mirrors of key online sources we rely on.
- Prefer open-licensed or public-domain materials.
- For copyrighted works, store **excerpts** with citation or store a **hash + URL** and a local **notes.md** (fair use).
- Track provenance and license in a sidecar `.license.md` file when possible.
